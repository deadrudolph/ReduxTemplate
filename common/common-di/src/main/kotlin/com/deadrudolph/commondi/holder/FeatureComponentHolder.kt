 *
 * Component holder with automatic cleaning.
 * Behaves same as [BaseComponentHolder], but holds component as a weak reference,
 * which means that reference will be cleaned in closest GC cycle if no one else holds reference to
 * component received by [get].
 *
 * It means that no need to call [set] and [clear] manually. Component builds during
 * first [get] calland cleared when there are not links to it is left.
 *
 * Can be useful to implement "feature scope": when user navigates outside of feature, the component
 * and all it's data most likely will be collected by GC.
